Question 1:

Main.java: https://github.com/aniskhan/CISC-3150/blob/master/HW2/1/src/Main.java

Question 2:

Main.java: https://github.com/aniskhan/CISC-3150/blob/master/HW2/2/src/Main.java
Sample Output: https://github.com/aniskhan/CISC-3150/blob/master/HW2/2/sampleOutput/sampleOutput.txt

Question 3:

Main.java: https://github.com/aniskhan/CISC-3150/blob/master/HW2/3/src/Main.java
Sample Output: https://github.com/aniskhan/CISC-3150/blob/master/HW2/3/sampleOutput/sampleOutput.txt

Question 4:

In the first code snippet, the value of x remains fixed at 4282. Thus the bit-shifting cycles indefinitely in the same pattern.

In the second code snippet, we reassign x, after shifting by i. Thus, we lose a part of x each time (by i number of bits). By the sixth iteration, x is zero, which will repeat forever beyond that point (b/c bit shifting zero equals zero).
	
(I just examined at the code; didn't look anything up other than the operator differences b/w Java / C++.)


Question 5:

I implemented this in Question 2. This drove me crazy because I knew it was the newline throwing me off, but totally forgot about the carriage return.


Question 6:

.useDelimiter("") ... which is crazy because I expected ".", the regex for any char. What's up with that?
