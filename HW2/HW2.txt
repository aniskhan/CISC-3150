Note: Use System.out.printf for the first two questions. That'll make 
formatting easier.

Question 1:
Write a program that asks the user how tall of a pyramid do they want to 
display on the screen, and then displays the pyramid that counts up on the 
left, and counts down on the right. For eg, if the user enters 4, the 
program shows:

        1
      1 2 1
    1 2 3 2 1
  1 2 3 4 3 2 1
  
Question 2: 
Write a program that displays a calendar on the screen. It asks the user 
the year, what day the first of January fell on, then displays every month 
from January to December. Make sure to get the leap years and the number 
of days in each month right. Your months should resemble the following 
format:

   February 2015      
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa  
 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  
 8  9 10 11 12 13 14  
15 16 17 18 19 20 21  
22 23 24 25 26 27 28 

Question 3:
Write a program to check whether a string is a palindrome (a string that's 
the same forward and backwards, for eg, madamimadam)

/* DON'T DO THIS ONE CUZ WE COVERED IT IN CLASS
Question 4:
Figure out why the following two pieces of code produce different outputs. 
MAKE SURE YOU CITE YOUR SOURCE FOR THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION.

int x = 4282;
for(int i=0;i<35;i++){
	System.out.printf("%d\t\t%32s\n",i,Integer.toBinaryString(x>>>i);
}

VS

int x = 4282;
for(int i=0;i<35;i++){
	System.out.printf("%d\t\t%32s\n",i,Integer.toBinaryString(x));
	x = x >>> i;
}

Question 5:
Change Scanner's delimiter, and tokenize comma separated values entered by 
the keyboard.

Question 6:
In our class, we talked about how the Scanner class doesn't have a method 
for tokenizing individual characters. But you're hell bent on forcing the 
Scanner class to tokenize the individual characters. What should you set 
your delimiter to?
